# Car Sales Report

The purpose of this project was to familiarize myself with Jupyter notebook, and expand upon my knowledge of Pandas, Numpy and MatplotLib. The dataset used was comprised of car sales of a business over the course of two years. I wanted to see if I could pull out any meaningful insights from the sales data that could help their business improve their sales department.
